# Pane

## Import

`import { Pane } from 'fannypack'`

## Basic Usage

A `<Pane>` is the same as a `<Box>`, except it has a default border radius, and has the ability to add different types of borders to it. Using `<Pane>` and `<Box>` together are most likely the two building blocks for the layout of your app.

<Playground>
  <Pane backgroundColor="white700" padding="8u">Hello world</Pane>
</Playground>

## Shadowed

<Playground>
  <Pane border="shadow" padding="8u">Hello world</Pane>
</Playground>

## Bordered

<Playground>
  <Pane border padding="8u">Hello world</Pane>
</Playground>

## Full width

<Playground>
  <Pane border isFullWidth padding="8u">Hello world</Pane>
</Playground>

## Props

<PropsTable component={Pane} />

## Theming

### Schema

```jsx
{
  Pane: {
    base: css | Object,

    // Styles to apply for bordered panes
    border: {
      default: css | Object,
      shadow: css | Object

```
