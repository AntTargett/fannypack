# Getting Started

## Installing Bumbag

Run the following command to install **Bumbag**:

```curl
yarn bumbag
```

## Getting set up

To start using the components, follow these steps:

1. Wrap your application in a `<ThemeProvider>` which is provided by **Bumbag**:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'bumbag';

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider>
    // ... your app
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

2. Now you can start using components like so:

```jsx
import { Button } from 'bumbag';

const MyApp = () => (
  <Button>
    Hello world!
  </Button>
);
```

No need to import any stylesheets. ðŸ˜‰

## Importing components

There are two ways to import Bumbag components.

Using:

- Named imports - `import { Button } from 'bumbag';`
- Default imports - `import Button from 'bumbag/Button';`

If you are using **Webpack@>=4**, **Rollup** or **Parcel**, then you can use named imports without it effecting your bundle size. However, if you are using older versions of Webpack or a bundler that does not support tree shaking, it is recommended to use default imports.
