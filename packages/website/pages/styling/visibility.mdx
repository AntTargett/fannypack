# Component Visibility

Sometimes you may want to hide a particular component on certain breakpoints. Fannypack makes this possible by attaching `hiddenBreakpoint` & `showBreakpoint` props on **every component**.

However, if you still want the children to be **read by screen readers** - it is recommended to use the `<VisuallyHidden>` component.

## Hiding on breakpoints

You can hide a component on a breakpoint by providing the breakpoint directly:

```.jsx
<Box hiddenBreakpoint="desktop">I am hidden on desktop only</Box>
```

You can even hide the component up to a certain breakpoint:

```.jsx
<Box hiddenBreakpoint="max-tablet">I am hidden on mobile & tablet</Box>
```

Or, hide the component when it hits a breakpoint:

```.jsx
<Box hiddenBreakpoint="min-desktop">I am hidden on desktop, widescreen & fullHD</Box>
```

## Showing on breakpoints

You can show a component on a breakpoint by providing the breakpoint directly:

```.jsx
<Box showBreakpoint="desktop">I am shown on desktop only</Box>
```

You can even show the component up to a certain breakpoint:

```.jsx
<Box showBreakpoint="max-tablet">I am shown on mobile & tablet</Box>
```

Or, show the component when it hits a breakpoint:

```.jsx
<Box showBreakpoint="min-desktop">I am shown on desktop, widescreen & fullHD</Box>
```

## `<VisuallyHidden>`

```.jsx
<VisuallyHidden>
  I am invisible but can still be read by a screen reader!
</VisuallyHidden>
```
