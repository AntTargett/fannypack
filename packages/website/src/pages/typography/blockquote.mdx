# Blockquote

```jsx
import { Blockquote } from 'fannypack'
```

`<Blockquote>` renders a `<blockquote>` element with reset styles and a left border.

TODO: change content to `<Paragraph>` and `<Text>`

```jsx-live
<Blockquote>
  <p>
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </p>
  <p>- Russell Coight</p>
</Blockquote>
<Blockquote backgroundColor="whitesmoke" marginTop="major-2">
  <p>
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </p>
  <p>- Russell Coight</p>
</Blockquote>
```

## Border styling

The left border can be modified using the primitive style props:

```jsx-live
<Blockquote borderColor="primary">
  <p>
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </p>
  <p>- Russell Coight</p>
</Blockquote>
```

Or you can hide the border:

```jsx-live
<Blockquote border="none">
  <p>
    "Out here, survival is the name of the game.
    Only it's not a game; it's deadly serious."
  </p>
  <p>- Russell Coight</p>
</Blockquote>
```
